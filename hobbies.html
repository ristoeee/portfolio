    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>This section is about the skills I've learned during the years both in work and my free time. </p>
    <p>
      Mountain biking has been my longest hobby and I have no plans to stop riding in the future.
      Computers have also been an object of interest decades both in free time and work. Photography
      is my "latest" hobby but due to lack of time haven't been shooting that much lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have to mention cars as a hobby even though there isn't own section for that. If you don't 
      look back to your car as you are walking away, you bought the wrong car. On my Instagram you can 
      find quite lot car related content. The most memorable experience related to cars is definitely 
      driving the Nordschleife.
